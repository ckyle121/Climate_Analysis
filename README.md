# Surf's Up Climate Analysis
## Overview of Project
Investors of a dual ice cream/ surf shop in Hawii seek to analyze weather data for the potential location of their shop in order to determine if they believe it is a weather permittable location for their shop.  

## Seasonal Results 
-The average temperature for both the winter and summer months is approximately around 72 degrees. This temperature is perfect for a day at the beach.
-The coldest temperature for the month of June is 64 degrees while the coldest temperature for the month of December is 56 degrees.
-The warmerst temperature for the month of June is 85 degrees while the warmest temperature for the month of December is 83 degrees.

As one can see, there is not much variance in the weather between the month of June and the month of December. It does not get too not, nor does it get too cold which is the ideal weather for surfers.

## Climate Analysis Summary 
The temperatures of the summer and winter months equally demonstrate that tourists and locals alike will be enjoying the warm temperatures of Oahu, HI all year long. Another potential set of statistics the investors might want to consider would be the amount of percipitation on the island of Oahu. Even if temperatures are nice and warm, rainfall could deter suferes away from the surf shop. Finally, the investors should also analyze the weather statistics from other islands in Hawaii to make sure they are investing in the best island for surfers and ice cream lovers.
